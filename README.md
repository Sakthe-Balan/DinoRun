# Fitosaur Run: Jump to Stay Alive!
"Fitosaur Run" is a Chrome Dino Run game that combines the fun of the classic game with the benefits of real-life exercise. The game uses computer vision technology to detect your jumps and translate them into in-game actions, allowing you to control the dino by jumping in real life.

The gameplay is simple: jump over obstacles to stay alive and earn points. The longer you survive, the more points you earn. But don't be fooled by the simplicity of the game - it's a great workout! You'll be jumping, squatting, and getting your heart rate up while you play.

The game is built with Python, Flask, and Mediapipe, and uses OpenCV to track your hand position and detect your jumps. It runs locally on your computer, so you can play it anytime and anywhere.

Whether you're looking for a fun way to stay active or just want to add some excitement to your Chrome browsing experience, "Fitosaur Run" is the game for you. Jump to stay alive, get fit, and have fun!
